### Tailwind CSS

:heavy_check_mark: Tailwind CSS can be described as a ```framework``` made-up of "low-level" ```css``` utility ```classes```

:heavy_check_mark: Ex. the ```"bg-white"``` ```class``` in ```<ele class="bg-white"></ele>``` will have the same result as
```css
ele {
  background-color: white;
}
```
<b>N.B</b> simply adding the ```"bg-white"``` class to ```ele``` will have the same effect as adding the ```background-color``` ```"white"``` to the ```css``` ```selector``` ```ele```
